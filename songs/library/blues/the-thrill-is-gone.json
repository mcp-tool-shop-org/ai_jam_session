    "description": "B.B. King's signature song and the definitive minor blues. Unlike the standard 12-bar major blues, this uses a minor tonality that gives it an aching, sophisticated quality. The piano part provides the harmonic bed over which the vocal and guitar cry.",
    "structure": "12-bar minor blues form: i-i-i-i / iv-iv-i-i / V-iv-i-V (turnaround). Repeats for verses.",
    "keyMoments": ["The opening Bm vamp: sets the dark, resigned mood", "The iv chord (Em): the emotional deepening in bars 5-6", "The V-iv-i turnaround: the classic minor blues resolution"],

    "styleTips": ["Play behind the beat slightly — blues drags, it doesn't rush", "Leave space — the rests are as important as the notes", "Tremolo chords in the right hand add B.B. King-style tension", "The left hand keeps a steady, sparse bass line — don't overplay"]
