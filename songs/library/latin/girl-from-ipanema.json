    "description": "The bossa nova standard that conquered the world. Jobim's harmonic genius disguises sophisticated jazz harmony behind a deceptively simple, swaying melody. The B section modulation — up a half step to Gb major — is one of the most elegant key changes in popular music.",
    "structure": "AABA form. A sections in F major, B section modulates to Gb then returns. 32 bars.",
    "keyMoments": ["The opening A melody: a languid, syncopated line over FMaj7 that defines bossa nova", "The B section modulation to Gb: the harmonic surprise that elevates the song", "The return to F major: the gentle resolution back home"],
    "teachingGoals": ["Bossa nova rhythmic pattern — the syncopated comping feel", "Extended jazz harmonies (Maj7, m7, dominant 7th)", "Chromatic voice leading through key changes", "The difference between bossa nova feel and straight jazz swing"],
    "styleTips": ["The rhythm is everything — bossa nova has a specific syncopated pattern, not swing", "Keep the touch light and even — bossa is intimate, not loud", "The left hand bass pattern should be steady and hypnotic", "Think of ocean waves — gentle, repetitive, mesmerizing"]
