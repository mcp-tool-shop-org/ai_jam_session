    "description": "Elton John's breakthrough — a piano ballad that proved rock could be tender. Written when he was 22, it's a masterclass in how a simple chord progression and sincere melody can be more powerful than any virtuoso display. The piano IS the band.",
    "structure": "Intro - Verse 1 - Verse 2 - Chorus - Verse 3 - Verse 4 - Chorus - Outro",
    "keyMoments": ["The opening Eb major chord: warm, open, inviting", "The Cm shift at 'If I was a sculptor': the first emotional turn", "The chorus build on 'I hope you don't mind': where the song opens up and soars"],
    "teachingGoals": ["Pop/rock piano ballad accompaniment patterns", "Chord inversions for smooth voice leading", "Building dynamics across verse-chorus structure", "Playing and singing simultaneously — keeping the piano independent"],
    "styleTips": ["Keep the left hand steady — simple bass notes or octaves", "The right hand should flow, not plod — connect the chords", "Build through each verse, don't play verse 4 like verse 1", "This is a love letter, not a performance — play it honestly"]
