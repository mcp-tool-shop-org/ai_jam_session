    "description": "The most famous ragtime piece ever written, and the piece that revived Joplin's legacy when it was featured in The Sting (1973). Ragtime is 'ragged time' — syncopated right-hand melodies over a steady left-hand oom-pah bass. Joplin insisted: 'It is never right to play ragtime fast.'",
    "structure": "AABBACCDD — classic ragtime multi-strain form. Each strain is 16 bars. The C and D strains modulate to F major (the subdominant).",
    "keyMoments": ["The iconic opening pickup notes: the most recognized piano intro in ragtime", "The B strain: contrasting, more lyrical character", "The modulation to F major at the C strain: a lift that changes the whole color", "The D strain: the final, most energetic section"],
    "teachingGoals": ["Ragtime left-hand pattern: bass note on 1 and 3, chord on 2 and 4 (oom-pah)", "Right-hand syncopation against steady left-hand pulse", "Multi-strain form navigation (AABBACCDD)", "Playing at Joplin's intended tempo — moderate, not fast"],
    "styleTips": ["DO NOT play this fast — Joplin was explicit about this", "The left hand must be rock steady — it's the timekeeper", "Right hand syncopation should feel playful, not frantic", "Each strain has its own character — bring out the contrasts", "No pedal in ragtime — clean, crisp articulation"]
