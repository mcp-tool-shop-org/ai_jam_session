    "description": "One of the most beloved jazz standards ever written. Originally titled 'In Other Words,' it became Frank Sinatra's signature after his 1964 recording. The melody descends in a graceful sequence through the circle of fifths, making it a perfect first jazz standard for piano students.",
    "structure": "ABAB — 32 bars. This excerpt: first 8 bars (A section)",
    "keyMoments": [
      "Bar 1-2: Am7 — the melody begins on C5 and descends stepwise. Instantly recognizable.",
      "Bar 3-4: Dm7 to G7 — the ii-V that defines the harmonic motion",
      "Bar 7-8: Em7 to A7 — the iii-VI introduces a secondary dominant pull"
    ],
    "teachingGoals": [
      "Descending stepwise melody — easy to memorize and sing",
      "Basic jazz chord progression: vi - ii - V - I",

    ],
    "styleTips": [
      "Swing the eighth notes — long-short, not even",
      "The melody should be legato and lyrical — imagine singing the words",
      "Left hand keeps it simple — whole notes or half notes are fine for beginners"
