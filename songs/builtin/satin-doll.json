    "description": "Duke Ellington's sophisticated swing masterpiece, co-written with Billy Strayhorn. The tune is built on a series of ii-V pairs that shift chromatically — Dm7-G7, then Em7-A7 — creating an elegant, serpentine harmonic motion. The melody is angular and hip, full of chromatic neighbor tones.",

    "keyMoments": [
      "Bar 1-2: Dm7 to G7 — first ii-V pair targeting C",
      "Bar 3-4: Em7 to A7 — second ii-V pair targeting D. The chromatic shift is the magic.",
