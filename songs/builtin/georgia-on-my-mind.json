    "description": "Ray Charles' definitive soul ballad reading of this Hoagy Carmichael standard. The arrangement uses rich jazz voicings with major seventh and ninth chords. The melody is deeply lyrical, moving in gentle arcs over a lush harmonic backdrop. The slow tempo demands expressive control and beautiful tone.",
    "structure": "A section (4 bars) with chromatic inner voice movement, B section (4 bars) with richer harmony",
    "keyMoments": [
      "Bar 1: Fmaj7 opens with warmth — the 'Georgia' call.",
      "Bars 3-4: The chromatic bass descent from F to D — heart of the arrangement.",
      "Bars 7-8: The Gm7-C7 turnaround — classic jazz resolution back to F."
    ],
    "teachingGoals": [
      "Jazz chord voicings — major 7ths and minor 7ths on piano",
      "Slow ballad phrasing — rubato and expressive timing",
      "Chromatic bass lines connecting diatonic chords"
    ],
    "styleTips": [
      "Play like Ray Charles is singing — every note should have weight and meaning",
      "Use sustain pedal generously but change on each chord",
      "The tempo should breathe — slight rubato on the melody peaks"
