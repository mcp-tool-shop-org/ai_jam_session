    "description": "John Williams' magical theme from Harry Potter, originally scored for celesta to create its otherworldly sparkle. In 3/8 time, the theme has a lilting, music-box quality that perfectly captures the wonder of the wizarding world. The melody features the distinctive minor-key intervals and the characteristic triplet-like motion that makes it instantly recognizable.",
    "structure": "A section: the celesta theme (4 bars), B section: the answer phrase with wider leaps (4 bars)",
    "keyMoments": [
      "Bar 1: B to E — the opening call. Magic is happening.",
      "Bar 3: The characteristic leap up to B4 — wonder and excitement.",
      "Bars 5-8: The answering phrase with its wider, more adventurous intervals."
    ],
    "teachingGoals": [
      "3/8 time — fast triple meter, one beat per bar",
      "Light, celesta-like touch on piano",
      "Minor key intervals that create a magical atmosphere"
    ],
    "styleTips": [
      "Play like a celesta — light, sparkling, crystalline",
      "Each bar should feel like one pulse, not three separate beats",
      "The magic is in the lightness — never heavy or thumping"
