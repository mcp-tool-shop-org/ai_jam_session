    "description": "A gospel-tinged pop song built on just three chords: Am, F, and C. The simplicity is its power — the emotional weight comes from the vocal melody and the gospel-soul harmonic flavor. This beginner arrangement uses block chords in the left hand with a straightforward vocal melody in the right.",
    "structure": "Verse-Chorus feel (8 bars) — Am-F-C repeated with subtle melodic variation",
    "keyMoments": [
      "Bars 1-2: Am to F — the minor-to-major shift gives the gospel flavor",
      "Bars 3-4: C major — the resolution that the ear craves",
      "Bars 5-8: The same progression with the melody reaching higher — building to an emotional peak"
    ],
    "teachingGoals": [
      "Three-chord song — Am, F, C in root position",
      "Playing with a soulful, slightly behind-the-beat feel",

    "styleTips": [
      "Play with a relaxed, soulful feel — slightly behind the beat, never ahead",
      "The left hand chords should have a soft, warm attack",
      "Think gospel choir — there is weight and warmth in every chord change"
