    "description": "The quintessential bossa nova, Jobim's masterpiece is built on a deceptively simple melody that floats over sophisticated jazz harmony. The A section stays in F major with Fmaj7 and G7 chords, while the famous bridge modulates through distant keys. The bossa nova rhythm in the left hand creates a gentle, hypnotic pulse that never rushes.",
    "structure": "A section: Fmaj7-G7 vamp (4 bars), Bridge: Gbmaj7-B9 modulation (4 bars)",
    "keyMoments": [
      "Bars 1-2: The signature melody — just three notes (G-A-G) repeated with rhythmic variation.",
      "Bar 5: Gbmaj7 — the famous modulation. Suddenly we're in a different world.",
      "Bar 8: Return to F — the journey home from the bridge."

    "styleTips": [
      "Bossa nova is quiet and intimate — never play loud",
      "Left hand rhythm is subtle — bass note then chord, gently syncopated",
