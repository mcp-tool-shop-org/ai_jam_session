    "description": "Elton John's spacefaring ballad, built on lush piano chords with a soaring melody. The verse uses a Bb-based progression with unexpected chromatic touches that evoke the weightlessness of space. This arrangement captures the dreamy, floating quality of the original piano part.",
    "structure": "Verse (8 bars) — Bb-Gm-Cm-F-Eb-Bb with melodic ascent and descent",
    "keyMoments": [
      "Bars 1-2: Bb to Gm — the warm opening that establishes the reflective mood",
      "Bars 3-4: Cm to F — the classic ii-V motion that gives the phrase momentum",
      "Bars 7-8: Eb to Bb — the plagal-flavored resolution, spacious and open"

    "styleTips": [
      "Play with a floating, weightless quality — this is music about space travel",
      "The chords should ring and overlap slightly, creating a lush wash of sound",
      "Melody should soar above the chords like a voice — Elton always thinks vocally"
