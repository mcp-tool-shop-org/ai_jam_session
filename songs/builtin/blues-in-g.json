    "description": "A straightforward 12-bar blues in G with a shuffle feel. This is the essential blues template that every pianist should know. Three dominant 7th chords (G7, C7, D7) and a simple melody built on the G blues scale. Master this and you can jam with anyone.",

    "keyMoments": [
      "Bar 1-4: G7 — four bars of the tonic. Settle into the shuffle groove.",
      "Bar 5-6: C7 — the IV chord arrives. Same melodic idea, new key center.",
