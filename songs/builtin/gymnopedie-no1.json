    "description": "The first of Satie's three Gymnopédies (1888), among the most recognizable piano pieces in the repertoire. Marked 'Lent et douloureux' (slow and sorrowful), it floats a simple melody over gently alternating seventh chords. Music at the edge of silence.",
    "structure": "Simple binary: A section (two phrases) with variation and gentle return. The melody descends through D major over an unwavering harmonic pendulum between Gmaj7 and D major.",
    "keyMoments": [
      "Measures 1-2: the bare chord introduction — two alternating harmonies that define the entire world of the piece",
      "Measure 3: the melody enters on F#5, floating above the chords like a thought arriving",
      "Measures 3-8: the first phrase — a gentle descent through D major, each note a small letting go",
      "Measures 9-14: the second phrase descends further, reaching into the lower register",
      "Measure 15: the melody returns to F#5, the same place but changed by the journey"
    ],
    "teachingGoals": [
      "Evenness of the LH quarter-note pattern — bass note, then two chord tones, completely unhurried",
      "RH legato: sustain each melody note fully, connecting them without accent",
      "Balance: the melody must float above the quiet chords — present but weightless",
      "Rhythmic independence: LH keeps steady pulse while RH sustains long notes",
      "Pedaling: sustain pedal changes on beat 1 of each measure to let the chord bloom"
    ],
    "styleTips": [
      "This piece is about what you don't play — the space between notes matters more than the notes themselves",
      "No rubato. Satie despised rubato. Keep the tempo absolutely steady, like a clock",
      "The entire dynamic range is pp to p. Never louder than a quiet conversation",
      "Think of each melody note as a droplet falling into still water",
      "The LH chords should feel like breathing — in, out, in, out — endlessly"

      "leftHand": "G2:q B3:q D4:q",
      "teachingNote": "The piece begins with the left hand alone. G major seventh chord: G in the bass, then B and D above. This chord will alternate with D major throughout. Play each note evenly — quarter, quarter, quarter — like a gentle heartbeat.",
      "dynamics": "pp"

      "teachingNote": "D major chord answers: D in the bass, F# and A above. These two measures establish the harmonic world — Gmaj7 to D, back and forth, forever. The entire piece lives inside this pendulum."

      "number": 3,
      "rightHand": "F#5:h R:q",
      "leftHand": "G2:q B3:q D4:q",
      "teachingNote": "The melody enters — F#5, high and clear, held for two beats. This is the first sound that sings. Let it float above the chord without any effort. The F# is the major seventh of G, creating a bittersweet shimmer.",
      "dynamics": "p"

      "leftHand": "D3:q F#3:q A3:q",
      "teachingNote": "The melody steps down one note to E5. Over the D major chord, E is the ninth — still floating, still unresolved. The descent has begun."

      "number": 5,
      "rightHand": "D5:h R:q",
      "leftHand": "G2:q B3:q D4:q",
      "teachingNote": "D5 — now the melody has found the tonic, but over the G chord it doesn't feel like home. This ambiguity is the soul of the piece."

      "rightHand": "B4:h R:q",
      "leftHand": "D3:q F#3:q A3:q",
      "teachingNote": "B4 — the melody continues its gentle descent. Over the D chord, B is the sixth — warm, open. Each note falls naturally, like leaves."

      "teachingNote": "The melody returns to F#5 — back where it started, but the journey has changed how we hear it. This return is the emotional center of the piece. The same note, the same chord, but now it carries everything that came before.",
