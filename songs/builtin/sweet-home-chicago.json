    "description": "Robert Johnson recorded this in 1936 and it became the anthem of Chicago blues. The shuffle groove is infectious — once you start, your foot will not stop tapping. The boogie-woogie left hand drives the train while the right hand plays a simple, singable melody.",
    "structure": "12-bar blues with shuffle feel. This excerpt: first 8 bars",
    "keyMoments": [
      "Bar 1-2: E7 shuffle — the left hand boogie pattern locks in the groove immediately",
      "Bar 3-4: E7 continues — repetition builds the hypnotic feel",
      "Bar 5-6: A7 — IV chord shift. The boogie pattern moves with it.",
      "Bar 7-8: E7 — back home. The shuffle never stops."

    "styleTips": [
      "The left hand is the engine — keep it absolutely steady",
      "Shuffle means triplet feel on the eighths: long-SHORT long-SHORT",
      "Right hand melody is secondary — the groove is what matters most"
