    "description": "One of the most recognizable piano intros in rock history. Jonathan Cain's opening riff is a simple broken chord pattern cycling through E-B-C#m-A. This beginner arrangement captures the essence of the riff with a simplified right-hand pattern and basic left-hand bass notes.",
    "structure": "Intro-Verse riff (8 bars) — E-B-C#m-A repeated twice",
    "keyMoments": [
      "Bars 1-2: E to B — the bright, optimistic opening that everyone knows",
      "Bars 3-4: C#m to A — the minor chord adds depth, then A brings it back to warmth",
      "Bars 5-8: Same progression repeated — by the second time, your hands know the way"
