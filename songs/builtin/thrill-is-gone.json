    "description": "B.B. King's signature song, recorded in 1969 with a string section that transformed blues forever. The minor key gives it a haunting, melancholy quality unlike standard major-key blues. The melody is sparse and vocal — every note is chosen with the economy of a master storyteller.",
    "structure": "Minor blues form (Bm-Em-F#7). This excerpt: first 8 bars",
    "keyMoments": [
      "Bar 1-2: Bm — the stark minor opening. Sparse melody over a simple bass.",
      "Bar 3-4: Bm continues — the space between notes IS the emotion",
      "Bar 5-6: Em — the iv chord deepens the sadness",
      "Bar 7-8: Bm — return to the tonic with a melodic sigh"
    ],
    "teachingGoals": [
      "Minor blues form — different from standard major 12-bar",
      "Economy of notes — saying more with less, B.B. King style",
      "Minor key voicings and the natural minor scale"
    ],
    "styleTips": [
      "Less is more — B.B. King was the master of one perfect note",
      "Let notes sustain and decay naturally — use the pedal",
      "The rests are emotional — they are where the listener feels the weight"
