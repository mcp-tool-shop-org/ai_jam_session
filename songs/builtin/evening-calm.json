    "description": "A deeply meditative piece for the end of the day. Simple, slow-moving harmonies in D minor create a contemplative space. The melody uses very few notes, letting silence and resonance do much of the work.",

    "keyMoments": ["Opening stillness in measure 1", "Gentle major resolution in measure 7"],
    "teachingGoals": ["Learn to use silence and space musically", "Practice slow, deliberate note placement with care"],
    "styleTips": ["Less is more — let each note resonate fully before playing the next", "Use pedal to create long, blending tones"]
