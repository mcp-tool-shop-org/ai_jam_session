    "description": "Sam Cooke's towering soul anthem, originally backed by sweeping strings. This piano arrangement captures the song's orchestral grandeur through wide-voiced chords and a soaring melody. The Bb major key has a warm, brassy quality, and the slow tempo allows every note to carry emotional weight.",
    "structure": "Verse: 4 bars building from quiet to powerful, Chorus: 4 bars with the anthemic climax",
    "keyMoments": [
      "Bar 1: The opening Bb major — quiet dignity before the storm.",
      "Bars 5-6: The chorus lift — 'A change is gonna come' — the melody reaches its peak on F5.",
      "Bar 8: The gentle descent and resolution — hope, not despair."
    ],
    "teachingGoals": [
      "Wide chord voicings to create orchestral fullness",
      "Dynamic range — from pp to ff within 8 bars",
      "Sustain pedal technique for legato bass movement"
    ],
    "styleTips": [
      "This song demands emotional commitment — play every phrase like it matters",
      "Build dynamics gradually — the climax in bar 6 should feel earned",
      "Left hand chord changes should be seamless — use pedal to connect"
