    "description": "Henry Mancini's dreamy waltz from Breakfast at Tiffany's is one of the most beloved film melodies. The wide opening interval (C to A, a major sixth) immediately establishes the song's yearning character. The simple C major harmony and gentle 3/4 waltz make this accessible for beginners, while the melody's beauty rewards even the simplest performance.",
