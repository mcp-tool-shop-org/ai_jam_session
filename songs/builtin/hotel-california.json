    "description": "An adaptation of the iconic guitar arpeggiation for piano. The song's verse uses a descending chord progression in B minor that creates its mysterious, hypnotic atmosphere. The piano arrangement preserves the flowing arpeggiated texture and the characteristic minor-key harmonic movement.",

    "keyMoments": [
      "Bars 1-2: Bm to F# — the dark opening with the dominant pull",
      "Bars 3-4: A to E — the relative major provides brief warmth",

      "Keep the arpeggiation even and hypnotic — this song casts a spell through repetition",
