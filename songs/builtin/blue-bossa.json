    "description": "A Latin jazz classic that blends bossa nova rhythm with jazz harmony. The tune sits primarily in C minor with a brief detour to Db major, creating a beautiful key-center shift. The bossa groove in the left hand should be steady and understated — think Rio, not New York.",
    "structure": "16-bar form (this excerpt: first 8 bars in C minor)",
    "keyMoments": [
      "Bar 1-2: Cm7 establishes the minor mood with bossa rhythm",
      "Bar 3-4: Fm7 — the iv chord adds depth to the minor tonality",
      "Bar 5-6: Dm7b5 to G7 — the classic minor ii-V, pulling toward resolution",
      "Bar 7-8: Cm7 — home. The ii-V resolves beautifully."
    ],
    "teachingGoals": [
      "Bossa nova left-hand pattern — root on 1, chord on the 'and' of 2",
      "Minor ii-V-i progression: Dm7b5 - G7 - Cm7",
      "Smooth voice leading between closely related chords"
    ],
    "styleTips": [
      "Bossa nova is gentle — no heavy accents, let the rhythm flow",
      "Left hand should be legato and quiet, creating a cushion",
      "Right hand melody is lyrical and singing — think of a vocalist"
