    "description": "Henry Mancini's slinky, chromatic theme is one of the most instantly recognizable melodies in cinema. Built on a chromatic creeping figure in E minor, the theme captures the sneaky, cat-like quality of the animated panther. The arrangement uses jazz swing feel with walking chromatic lines and punchy staccato chords. The left hand plays a cool jazz bass pattern.",
    "structure": "Intro creep (2 bars), Main riff with chromatic climb (4 bars), Tag (2 bars)",
    "keyMoments": [
      "Bars 1-2: The famous chromatic creep — E-F-F#-G. The panther appears.",
      "Bars 5-6: The riff hits its stride with the jazzy chord stabs.",
      "Bar 8: The sly ending — chromatic slide back to E. The panther vanishes."

    "teachingGoals": [
      "Chromatic movement — half-step creeping motion",
      "Jazz swing feel — slightly uneven eighth notes",
      "Staccato articulation for the sneaky character"

    "styleTips": [
      "Slinky and sneaky — imagine tiptoeing past a security guard",
      "Swing the eighth notes slightly — not straight, not full shuffle",
      "Every note should be staccato and precise — the panther is smooth"
