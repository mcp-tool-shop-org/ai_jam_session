    "description": "The epic piano ballad that proved hard rock bands could be deeply emotional. The intro uses arpeggiated chords in C major with a soaring melodic line that builds from quiet contemplation to dramatic intensity. This arrangement focuses on the iconic piano introduction.",
    "structure": "Intro-Verse (8 bars) — C-Csus4-C-Dm-G-C progression with arpeggiated accompaniment",
    "keyMoments": [
      "Bars 1-2: C major with suspended 4th — the signature rocking between C and Csus4",
      "Bars 5-6: Dm to G — the dramatic harmonic lift that signals the verse is arriving",
      "Bars 7-8: Full chordal resolution — the arrangement opens up to its grandest texture"

      "The arpeggiation should be fluid and romantic, not mechanical",
      "Build the dynamics gradually — this is an epic, and epics need a slow burn",
      "The sus4 to major resolution is the emotional heart — give it space"
