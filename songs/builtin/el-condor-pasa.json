    "description": "The Peruvian Andean folk melody, composed in 1913 and later popularized internationally, is built on the pentatonic scale that gives it its distinctive soaring quality. The melody evokes the flight of a condor over the Andes — wide intervals and open voicings create a sense of vast space. The arrangement uses the E minor pentatonic scale throughout, keeping the authentic Andean sound.",
    "structure": "A section: pentatonic melody over Em-G (4 bars), B section: ascending climax over Am-Em (4 bars)",
    "keyMoments": [
      "Bars 1-2: The opening pentatonic melody — instantly recognizable, soaring and open.",
      "Bar 5: The melody reaches its highest point — the condor at its peak.",
      "Bars 7-8: The gentle descent — the condor gliding back down."

    "styleTips": [
      "Think of wide open spaces — the Andes mountains. Let notes ring.",
      "The melody should soar — use legato and sustain pedal generously",
      "Left hand should be sparse and open — fifths and octaves, not dense chords"
