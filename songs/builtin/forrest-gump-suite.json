    "description": "Alan Silvestri's gentle piano theme accompanies the floating feather in Forrest Gump's opening and closing scenes. The melody is built on simple, stepwise motion in C major with a childlike innocence that mirrors Forrest's character. The arrangement is deliberately sparse — the beauty comes from the simplicity and the space between notes. This is music about floating, not flying.",
    "structure": "Feather floating: gentle ascending figures (4 bars), Settling: descending resolution (4 bars)",
    "keyMoments": [
      "Bars 1-2: The feather begins its journey — gentle ascending thirds.",
      "Bars 3-4: The melody drifts higher — weightless and innocent.",
      "Bars 7-8: The feather lands — the simplest, most peaceful resolution."
    ],
    "teachingGoals": [
      "Gentle, controlled touch at soft dynamics",
      "Playing simple music beautifully — less is more",

    "styleTips": [
      "Imagine a feather floating on the breeze — weightless, drifting",
      "Never play louder than mp — this music is about quietness",
      "Use plenty of sustain pedal — let the notes blend and float"
