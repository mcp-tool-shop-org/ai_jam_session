    "description": "Originally by Memphis Slim, this became a hit for B.B. King in 1955. It is a perfect medium-tempo blues with a walking bass line and a singable melody. The walking left hand moves in steady quarter notes, creating a sense of forward motion like a slow train rolling.",
    "structure": "12-bar blues with walking bass. This excerpt: first 8 bars",
    "keyMoments": [
      "Bar 1-2: Bb7 — walking bass line starts its journey. Steady and relentless.",
      "Bar 3-4: Bb7 — melody enters with a simple blues phrase",
      "Bar 5-6: Eb7 — the IV chord. Walking bass adjusts to the new root.",
      "Bar 7-8: Bb7 — home again. The bass never stops walking."

    "styleTips": [
      "Walking bass should be smooth and connected — legato quarter notes",
      "The bass walks BETWEEN chord tones using scale and chromatic passing tones",
      "Right hand stays simple — let the walking bass do the heavy lifting"
