    "description": "The dramatic piano introduction to one of rock's greatest compositions. The opening features rich chordal harmonies with chromatic voice leading, building from a quiet Bb6 chord to the powerful vocal entry. This arrangement captures the harmonic density and dramatic arc of the original.",
    "structure": "Intro (8 bars) — Bb6-C7-F7-Bb with chromatic passing chords and dramatic build",
    "keyMoments": [
      "Bars 1-2: The a cappella-style opening — Bb6 chord with rich voicing",
      "Bars 3-4: Chromatic movement downward — the harmonic tension builds",
      "Bars 7-8: The dramatic climax before the verse begins — full chordal texture"

      "Start extremely quietly and build gradually — the drama is in the crescendo",
      "Voice each chord carefully — every note should ring clearly",
