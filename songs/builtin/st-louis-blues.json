    "description": "The 'Father of the Blues' wrote this in 1914, and it became one of the most recorded songs in history. The first section uses a habanera/tango rhythm that distinguishes it from standard 12-bar blues. The melody mixes blues notes with a sophisticated, almost orchestral sensibility.",
    "structure": "12-bar blues form. This excerpt: 8 bars of the opening section",
    "keyMoments": [
      "Bar 1-2: The habanera-flavored opening — NOT a standard shuffle. Feel the dotted rhythm.",
      "Bar 3-4: G7 with blue notes — the melody bends between major and minor thirds",
      "Bar 5-6: C7 (IV chord) — the harmony opens up while the habanera continues",
      "Bar 7-8: Return to G7 with a classic blues turnaround feel"
    ],
    "teachingGoals": [
      "Habanera rhythm — dotted-quarter + eighth + two quarters",
      "Blue notes — the ambiguity between major and minor 3rd (B vs Bb)",
      "Historical blues form — understanding the roots of American music"
    ],
    "styleTips": [
      "The habanera feel is the key — do not play this as a straight shuffle",
      "Blue notes should be slightly hesitant, not clean — they live between the cracks",
      "Left hand is steady and rhythmic — it anchors the exotic rhythm"
