    "description": "A flowing piece that captures the movement of water over smooth stones. The right hand plays continuous sixteenth-note arpeggios that ripple across the keyboard while the left hand provides a deep, anchoring bass line.",
    "structure": "Through-composed flowing arpeggio piece (8 bars)",
    "keyMoments": ["Continuous water-like flow begins in measure 1", "Minor-to-major shift in measure 5"],
    "teachingGoals": ["Develop even sixteenth-note arpeggio technique", "Practice sustaining a flowing texture while the bass moves independently"],
    "styleTips": ["Keep the right hand perfectly even — the water flows without interruption", "Pedal changes on each new harmony to keep the stream clear"]
