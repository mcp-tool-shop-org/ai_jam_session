    "description": "One of the most covered songs in history, originally performed with a string quartet. The melody is singable and poignant, moving through F major with surprising chromatic touches. This simplified arrangement focuses on the vocal melody with basic chord support.",
    "structure": "Verse (8 bars) — F-Em7-A7-Dm-Bb-C-F progression with melodic narrative",
    "keyMoments": [
      "Bars 1-2: F major opening — the melody immediately establishes the wistful mood",
      "Bars 3-4: A7 to Dm — the harmonic surprise that gives the song its distinctive color",
      "Bars 7-8: Bb-C-F cadence — the classic resolution that brings the verse home"

      "Play the melody as if you were singing it — breathe where a singer would",
