    "description": "The most widely recognized hymn in the English-speaking world. Words by John Newton (1772), a former slave ship captain who found faith. The melody — likely of Scottish or Irish origin — is pentatonic: just five notes (G, A, B, D, E). That simplicity is its power. No chromatic tension, no dissonance. Pure, open, and universal.",
    "structure": "Four 4-bar phrases (ABAC form): A rises from G to D, B reaches the peak on high D and descends, A returns, C resolves with a gentle descent to the tonic. This arrangement covers the complete first verse — the melody everyone knows.",
    "keyMoments": [
      "Measure 1: The pickup — G3 alone, the lowest note, rising. A voice beginning to speak.",
      "Measures 2-5: First phrase — the melody rises from B3 through D4 to B4. An arc of hope.",
      "Measures 6-9: Second phrase — the melody reaches D5, the highest point. The peak of 'grace'.",
      "Measures 10-13: Third phrase — the melody returns to the opening, but we hear it differently now.",
      "Measures 14-18: Final phrase — the melody descends gently to G4. Home. Rest."
    ],
    "teachingGoals": [
      "Pentatonic melody: only G, A, B, D, E are used. No C, no F#. This is the sound of folk music worldwide.",
      "3/4 waltz time: three beats per measure. Feel the gentle sway — ONE two three, ONE two three.",
      "Legato phrasing: connect every note to the next. No gaps. The melody should sing.",
      "Simple chord accompaniment: I (G), IV (C), V (D) — the three chords of folk music.",
      "Dynamic arc: start soft, build to the peak, settle back. The music breathes."
    ],
    "styleTips": [
      "This is a hymn. Sing it in your mind as you play. If the melody doesn't sing, slow down.",
      "The simplicity is the difficulty. Every note must be placed with intention.",
      "Sustain pedal on beat 1 of each measure, lift on beat 3. Let the harmony bloom.",
      "The left hand should be felt, not heard. Gentle chords underneath the melody.",
      "No rubato in the middle of phrases. Save any tempo flexibility for phrase endings."
