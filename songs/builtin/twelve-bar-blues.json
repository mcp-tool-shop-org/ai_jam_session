    "description": "The 12-bar blues is not a song — it's a language. This chord progression (I-I-I-I, IV-IV-I-I, V-IV-I-V) is the foundation of blues, rock and roll, R&B, boogie-woogie, and jazz blues. In C: C7, F7, G7. Three chords, twelve bars, infinite expression. Every blues musician alive knows this form by heart.",
    "structure": "Three 4-bar phrases: (1) Statement — I chord establishes the key, (2) Response — IV chord lifts, returns to I, (3) Resolution — V chord creates tension, IV answers, I resolves, V turnaround. This is call-and-response in its purest harmonic form.",
    "keyMoments": [
      "Measures 1-4: The I chord (C7) — four bars to tell your story. The melody uses the blues scale: C, Eb, F, F#, G, Bb.",
      "Measure 5: The IV chord (F7) arrives — the harmony lifts. Same melody, different ground underneath.",
      "Measure 7: Back to I (C7) — the return feels like coming home.",
      "Measure 9: The V chord (G7) — peak tension. This is the emotional climax of the 12-bar form.",
      "Measure 12: The turnaround (V chord) — sets up the repeat. In blues, the form never ends. It cycles."
    ],
    "teachingGoals": [
      "The I-IV-V chord relationship — the three most important chords in Western music",
      "Blues scale: C Eb F F# G Bb C — the b3, b5 (blue note), and b7 give blues its soul",
      "Left hand shuffle pattern: root-5th alternation with a swing feel",
      "The concept of the turnaround — how the last bar sets up the next chorus",
      "Dominant 7th chords: every chord in blues is a 7th chord (1-3-5-b7)"
    ],
    "styleTips": [
      "Swing the eighths. Straight eighths in blues sound wrong.",
      "The left hand drives — it's the rhythm section. Keep it steady and grounded.",
      "Bend into notes mentally — the space between Eb and E, between F and F#, is where blues lives",
      "Don't fill every beat. Space and silence are expressive tools.",
      "The V-IV-I resolution (bars 9-11) should feel like exhaling after holding your breath"
