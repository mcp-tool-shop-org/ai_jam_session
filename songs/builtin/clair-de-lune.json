    "description": "The third movement of Debussy's Suite bergamasque (1890/1905), inspired by Paul Verlaine's poem of the same name. Clair de Lune — moonlight — is among the most beloved piano pieces ever written. The opening section floats a bare, singing melody over gently sustained harmonies, evoking moonlight on still water.",
    "structure": "Three sections: A (gentle opening melody, pp), B (flowing arpeggiated middle section), A' (return of the opening, transformed). This arrangement covers the opening A section — the most iconic passage.",
    "keyMoments": [
      "Measures 1-2: the melody enters alone, unaccompanied — a voice in the dark",
      "Measure 3: the bass enters with low Db, grounding the floating melody",
      "The melody's gentle ascent to Eb5 and F5 — the highest, brightest point, like moonlight breaking through",
      "Measures 11-12: the harmony shifts to Bbm and Gb, adding depth and shadow",
      "The final measures settle back to Db major — the moonlight finding its reflection"
    ],
    "teachingGoals": [
      "Playing in Db major — 5 flats (Db Eb F Gb Ab Bb C), requiring comfort with black keys",
      "9/8 time: feel the music in three groups of three eighth notes per measure",
      "Extreme dynamic control — the opening is pp, barely audible, like a whisper",
      "Melodic shaping: the melody must sing above the bass, connected and flowing",
      "Pedaling: long sustain pedal to let harmonies blend, changing with the bass"
    ],
    "styleTips": [
      "Imagine actual moonlight — silver, cool, endlessly patient",
      "The melody should sound like it's floating, not walking. No rhythmic emphasis.",
      "Each group of three eighth notes should flow like water, not tick like a clock",
      "The bass notes are like the earth — deep, dark, barely moving while the melody drifts above",
      "Debussy said: 'Music is the silence between the notes.' Honor the rests."
