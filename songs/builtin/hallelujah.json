    "description": "A folk-pop masterpiece in 6/8 time, built on a descending chord progression that mirrors the lyrical gravity. The arpeggiated accompaniment gives it a hymn-like, meditative quality. This arrangement uses the verse section with its iconic I-V-vi-IV-V progression.",
    "structure": "Verse (8 bars) in 6/8 — C-Am-C-Am-F-G-C-G cycle",
    "keyMoments": [
      "Bars 1-2: C to Am — the descending bass establishes the reflective mood",
      "Bars 5-6: F to G — the harmonic lift toward the 'Hallelujah' moment",
      "Bars 7-8: C to G — resolution and preparation to repeat"

    "styleTips": [
      "Feel the 6/8 as a gentle rocking motion — ONE-two-three FOUR-five-six",
      "The left hand arpeggio should be completely even, like a lullaby",
      "Right-hand melody floats above — sing it in your head as you play"
