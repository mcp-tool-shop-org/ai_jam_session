    "description": "One of the most performed Latin songs ever written, this bolero by Consuelo Velazquez is built on passionate D minor harmony with dramatic leaps in the melody. The arrangement captures the song's yearning quality through expressive chord voicings and a melody that reaches upward with romantic urgency. The bolero rhythm in the left hand provides a gentle, swaying pulse.",
    "structure": "A section: Dm-Gm-A7-Dm (4 bars), B section: chromatic intensification (4 bars)",
    "keyMoments": [
      "Bar 1: Dm — the melody's opening leap from D to A sets the passionate tone.",
      "Bar 3: A7 — the dominant with its sharp leading tone C#. Maximum tension.",
      "Bars 5-6: The bridge lifts to Bb major — a moment of warmth in the minor landscape."

    "styleTips": [
      "Play with passion but control — bolero is smoldering, not explosive",
      "Melody should sing and sustain — use pedal for legato",
      "Left hand bolero pattern: bass note, then chord, gently rocking"
