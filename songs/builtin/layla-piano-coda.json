    "description": "The legendary piano coda of Layla, composed by drummer Jim Gordon. One of the most beautiful piano passages in rock, it transforms a raw blues-rock song into something transcendent. The piece features a memorable ascending melody over rich chord changes, building from a gentle statement to a passionate climax.",
    "structure": "Piano Coda (8 bars) — C-C/E-F-F/A-Bb-C repeated with melodic development and embellishment",
    "keyMoments": [
      "Bars 1-2: The iconic ascending melody over C to F — the theme that transforms the entire song",
      "Bars 3-4: Bb to C — the IV to I cadence with the melody at its peak",
      "Bars 5-8: The theme repeats with richer voicings and higher register melody"
    ],
    "teachingGoals": [
      "Singing melodic line over supportive chordal accompaniment",
      "Voice leading through chord inversions (C, C/E, F, F/A)",
      "Dynamic shaping of a repeated theme — each pass grows in intensity"
    ],
    "styleTips": [
      "The melody should sing like a human voice — this is a lament",
      "The first statement is gentle and reflective; the repeat is passionate and full",
      "Use pedal generously to create a warm, connected wash of sound"
