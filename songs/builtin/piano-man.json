    "description": "The quintessential piano song in 3/4 waltz time. Billy Joel's signature piece uses a bouncing waltz pattern that propels the storytelling forward. This arrangement covers the verse section with its classic C-G-F-C movement and the characteristic oom-pah-pah left hand.",
    "structure": "Verse (8 bars in 3/4) — C-G/B-F/A-C waltz pattern with melodic development",
    "keyMoments": [
      "Bars 1-2: C major waltz — the iconic 'oom-pah-pah' pattern establishes the bar-room feel",
      "Bars 3-4: F to G — the melody climbs, building narrative momentum",
      "Bars 7-8: Am to G to C — the verse resolution with a satisfying cadence"

    "styleTips": [
      "Emphasize beat 1 in the left hand — the 'oom' should be slightly louder than the 'pah-pah'",
      "Right hand sings the melody above the waltz — think of it as a vocalist over a piano bar trio",
      "Keep a steady, swaying tempo — this is dance music at heart"
