    "description": "The silky smooth jazz-soul classic built on one of the most beloved chord progressions in R&B: Dbmaj7-C7-Fm7-Ebm7-Ab7. This arrangement focuses on the lush chord voicings that define the song's character, with a gentle melodic line floating above. The Db major key gives it a rich, velvety warmth.",
    "structure": "The signature 4-chord vamp (4 bars) then melodic development over the same changes (4 bars)",
    "keyMoments": [
      "Bar 1: Dbmaj7 — the lush opening. Pure silk.",
      "Bar 2: C7 to Fm — the chromatic bass drop that makes this progression magical.",
      "Bars 5-8: Melody takes center stage over the same chords — more ornamental."

    "teachingGoals": [
      "The classic 'Just the Two of Us' chord progression — used in hundreds of songs",

    "styleTips": [
      "Silky smooth — every chord change should melt into the next",
      "Right hand melody should float above, never dig in",
      "Left hand voices the chords gently — think Rhodes electric piano, not acoustic attack"
