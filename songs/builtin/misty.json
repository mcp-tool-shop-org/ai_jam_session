    "description": "Erroll Garner's most famous composition — a lush, romantic ballad with wide melodic leaps and rich chromatic harmony. The opening octave leap (Bb to Bb) is one of the most recognizable gestures in all of jazz. The chords are dense and colorful, requiring careful voicing and pedal technique.",
    "structure": "AABA — 32 bars. This excerpt: first A section (8 bars)",
    "keyMoments": [
      "Bar 1: The signature octave leap Bb4 to Bb5 — sets the dreamy mood instantly",
      "Bar 3-4: Chromatic inner voice movement as chords shift — Abm7 to Db7",
      "Bar 7-8: The phrase resolves with a gentle rubato feel — take your time"
    ],
    "teachingGoals": [
      "Wide melodic intervals — reaching across the keyboard with confidence",
      "Rich jazz ballad voicings with extensions (9ths, 13ths)",
      "Rubato phrasing — stretching and compressing time expressively"
    ],
    "styleTips": [
      "Use sustain pedal generously — this is a lush ballad, let chords ring",
      "The melody should sing above everything — bring it out with touch",
      "Tempo is flexible — slow down at phrase peaks, move forward in transitions"
