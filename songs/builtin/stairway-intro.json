    "description": "An adaptation of the legendary guitar fingerpicking intro for piano. The original features a chromatic descending bass line under arpeggiated chords, creating one of the most recognizable openings in rock history. This piano arrangement preserves the descending bass motion and the delicate arpeggiated texture.",
    "structure": "Intro (8 bars) — Am descending bass line: A-G#-G-F#-F-E with arpeggiated chords above",
    "keyMoments": [
      "Bars 1-4: The chromatic descent from A to F — each bass note drops a half step while the upper voices sustain",
      "Bars 5-6: The arrival at F major and the mood shift",
      "Bars 7-8: G to Am resolution — the descent completes its cycle"

    "styleTips": [
      "Play delicately — this is fingerpicking, not strumming",
      "The bass line descent should be smooth and connected, like a slow walk downstairs",
      "Let the upper notes ring while the bass moves — use pedal carefully"
