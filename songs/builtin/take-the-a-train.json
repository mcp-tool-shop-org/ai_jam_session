    "description": "Billy Strayhorn wrote this tune on the subway, and it became the theme song of the Duke Ellington Orchestra. The melody is bright and optimistic, built on a simple ascending figure over basic jazz changes. The #4 note (F#) over C major gives it that distinctive, sparkling lift.",
    "structure": "AABA — 32 bars. This excerpt: first A section (8 bars)",
    "keyMoments": [
      "Bar 1-2: The ascending melody with the characteristic F#4 — the lydian sparkle",
      "Bar 3-4: Melody continues climbing toward G5 — riding the A train uptown",
      "Bar 7-8: Phrase resolves to C with a classic swing ending figure"
    ],
    "teachingGoals": [
      "Swing feel at a comfortable medium tempo",
      "The #4 (F#) over a major chord — lydian color in practice",
      "Simple left-hand stride: bass note on 1-3, chord on 2-4"
    ],
    "styleTips": [
      "Bright and happy — this tune smiles. Play with energy.",
      "Swing the eighths but keep it light — medium swing, not heavy",
      "The F# is not a mistake — lean into it, that is the sound"
