    "description": "Otis Redding's laid-back masterpiece captures the feeling of watching the tide roll in. Built on a simple G-B7-C-A progression, the song is accessible for beginners while sounding musically complete. The melody is conversational and unhurried, and the left hand plays simple root-position chords.",
