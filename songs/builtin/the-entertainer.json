    "description": "Scott Joplin's most famous rag, published in 1902. The Entertainer is built on the contrast between a syncopated, playful right hand melody and a steady left hand 'oom-pah' pattern. Joplin marked it 'Not fast' — ragtime is not about speed, it's about the tension between the off-beat melody and the on-beat bass. That rhythmic tug is what makes it swing.",
    "structure": "Classic ragtime AABB form. This arrangement covers the A section (the intro theme) — the melody everyone recognizes. Two 8-bar phrases: the first states the theme, the second repeats with slight variation and a stronger ending.",
    "keyMoments": [
      "Measures 1-2: The iconic opening — the syncopated pickup figure that everyone knows. D4-E4-C5-E5, landing on the downbeat of measure 2.",
      "Measures 3-4: The melody climbs to E5 with syncopation, while the left hand keeps steady oom-pah.",
      "Measures 5-6: The melody descends through a chromatic passage — E5, D5, C5 — with eighth-note syncopation.",
      "Measure 8: The first phrase ends with a resolution to C4 — a small cadence.",
      "Measures 9-16: Second pass with variation — the melody adds chromatic passing tones."
    ],
    "teachingGoals": [
      "Syncopation: the right hand plays BETWEEN the left hand beats. This rhythmic offset is the soul of ragtime.",
      "Left hand oom-pah: bass note on beats 1 and 3, chord on beats 2 and 4. Metronomic. Unwavering.",
      "Independence: hands must operate on different rhythmic tracks without pulling each other off time.",
      "Dynamics through touch: make the melody sing above the accompaniment through finger weight, not volume.",
      "Tempo discipline: Joplin said 'It is never right to play ragtime fast.' Honor the groove."
    ],
    "styleTips": [
      "NOT FAST. Joplin wrote this instruction on his scores. If it feels rushed, slow down.",
      "The left hand is a clock. The right hand dances around it. Never let the right hand speed up the left.",
      "Slight accent on the syncopated notes — make the listener feel the off-beat emphasis",
      "Keep the left hand quieter than the right. The bass and chords are the frame, not the picture.",
      "Think of it as stride piano in embryo — the precursor to jazz piano"

      "teachingNote": "The iconic opening figure. The right hand starts with a rest on beat 1 — the melody enters off the beat. D4-E4-C5-E4-C5-E5: a zigzag climb that everyone recognizes. Left hand plays C major chord tones in an oom-pah figure.",
