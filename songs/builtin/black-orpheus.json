    "description": "From the 1959 film Black Orpheus, this haunting bossa nova in A minor is one of the most beloved Brazilian compositions. The melody has a wistful, singing quality that moves through the natural and harmonic minor scales. The chord progression features the classic ii-V-i jazz pattern applied to bossa nova, creating a sophisticated but deeply emotional piece.",
    "structure": "A section: Am-Bm7b5-E7-Am descent (4 bars), B section: Dm7-G7-Cmaj7 relative major excursion (4 bars)",
    "keyMoments": [
      "Bar 1: Am — the opening melody rises like a morning in Rio.",
      "Bars 3-4: E7 to Am — the ii-V-i resolution in minor. The G# gives it bite.",
      "Bars 5-6: Dm7 to G7 to Cmaj7 — briefly touching the relative major. A ray of sunlight."

    "styleTips": [
      "More melancholy than Girl from Ipanema — keep the minor color present",
      "The melody should float but with a hint of sadness",
      "Bossa rhythm stays gentle even when the harmony gets dark"
