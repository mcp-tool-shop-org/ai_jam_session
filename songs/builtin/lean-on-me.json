    "description": "Bill Withers' gospel-soul anthem is built on a simple ascending piano figure in C major. The beauty is in its directness — stepwise motion in the melody over basic triads. This is one of the most rewarding beginner pieces because it sounds full and satisfying with minimal technique.",
    "structure": "Verse pattern: C-Dm-Em-F ascending, then F-Em-Dm-C descending (8 bars)",
    "keyMoments": [
      "Bars 1-4: The ascending walk up from C to F — each chord lifts the melody higher.",
      "Bars 5-8: The descending return — mirror image, bringing it home to C."
    ],
    "teachingGoals": [
      "Stepwise chord movement — moving one chord at a time up the scale",
      "Simple left hand root-fifth patterns",
      "Singing quality in the right hand melody"
    ],
    "styleTips": [
      "Play with warmth — this is a song about community and support",
      "Let the melody ring — use legato pedaling",
      "Left hand should be gentle and supportive, not heavy"
