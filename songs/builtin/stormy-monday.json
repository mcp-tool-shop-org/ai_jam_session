    "description": "T-Bone Walker's 1947 classic is the gold standard for slow, sophisticated blues. Unlike basic 12-bar blues, Stormy Monday uses jazzy 9th chords and a turnaround that passes through unusual changes. The slow tempo demands expressive phrasing — every note must count.",
    "structure": "12-bar blues with jazz substitutions. This excerpt: first 8 bars",
    "keyMoments": [
      "Bar 1-2: G9 — the rich 9th chord sets this apart from basic blues immediately",
      "Bar 3-4: G9 continues with melodic embellishments — slow and expressive",
      "Bar 5-6: C9 (IV chord) — same lush voicing moved to the subdominant",
      "Bar 7-8: Return to G9 — the melody weeps and sighs"
    ],
    "teachingGoals": [
      "9th chord voicings — richer than basic dominant 7ths",
      "Slow blues phrasing — stretching time, bending the beat",
      "Dynamic control at slow tempos — every note has weight"
    ],
    "styleTips": [
      "This is SLOW — do not rush. Let every note breathe and decay.",
      "The 9th chords give a sophisticated, jazzy color. Lean into them.",
      "Think of a vocalist on every melody note — where would they breathe?"
