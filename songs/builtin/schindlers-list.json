    "description": "John Williams' devastating violin theme transcribed for piano. The melody, originally played by Itzhak Perlman, is one of the most emotionally powerful pieces in film music. The A minor tonality carries deep sorrow, while the melody's wide leaps and expressive intervals demand advanced phrasing and dynamic control. The left hand provides a spare, grief-laden accompaniment.",
    "structure": "A section: the main theme with its characteristic leap (4 bars), B section: development and emotional climax (4 bars)",
    "keyMoments": [
      "Bar 1: The opening A — a single note that carries the weight of history.",
      "Bars 3-4: The wide leap upward — the melody's most expressive moment.",
      "Bar 6: The emotional climax on E5 — ff, full of grief and beauty."
    ],
    "teachingGoals": [
      "Transcribing violin expressiveness to piano — singing tone, vibrato-like dynamics",
      "Wide interval leaps with smooth connection",
      "Advanced dynamic control from pp to ff within phrases"
    ],
    "styleTips": [
      "Play as if this is the most important melody you will ever play",
      "Each note must connect to the next, even across wide leaps — use pedal",
      "The silences between phrases are as important as the notes"
