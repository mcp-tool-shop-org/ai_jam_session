    "description": "A slow, deeply expressive blues in Bb that demands advanced harmonic vocabulary and emotional phrasing. At 60 BPM, every beat is an eternity — you must fill the space with intention. Rich 9th and 13th voicings, chromatic passing tones, and gospel-influenced turnarounds make this a graduate-level blues study.",
    "structure": "Slow 12-bar blues with substitutions. This excerpt: 8 bars",
    "keyMoments": [
      "Bar 1-2: Bb9 — wide voicings with the 9th and 13th. The slow tempo demands rich harmony.",
      "Bar 3-4: Chromatic approach and grace notes — filling the slow tempo with expression",
      "Bar 5-6: Eb9 — the IV chord with jazz-gospel color changes",
      "Bar 7-8: Bb9 with chromatic inner movement — sophisticated voice leading"
    ],
    "teachingGoals": [
      "Extended chord voicings — 9ths, 13ths, altered dominants",
      "Filling slow tempos with expressive ornaments and grace notes",
      "Chromatic voice leading between blues changes",
      "Gospel turnaround influence in blues piano"
    ],
    "styleTips": [
      "At 60 BPM, time stretches — fill it with intent, not filler",
      "Grace notes and ornaments should be vocal — think of a singer bending notes",
      "Use sustain pedal to let rich voicings ring and blend",
      "Dynamic range matters more at slow tempos — use the full spectrum"
