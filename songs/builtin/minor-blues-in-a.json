    "description": "A minor-key 12-bar blues with a darker, moodier sound than standard major-key blues. The Am7-Dm7-E7 progression creates tension without resolution, a haunting quality that influenced everything from jazz to rock. The A minor blues scale (A C D Eb E G) provides the melodic vocabulary.",

    "keyMoments": [
      "Bar 1-2: Am7 — the minor tonic sets a dark, introspective mood",
      "Bar 3-4: Am7 continues — the melody uses the minor blues scale with Eb (the blue note)",
      "Bar 5-6: Dm7 — minor iv chord. The darkness deepens.",

      "Play with a darker touch — less bounce, more weight",
