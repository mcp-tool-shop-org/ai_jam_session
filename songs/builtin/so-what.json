    "description": "The opening track from Kind of Blue — the best-selling jazz album in history. Built on just two scales (D dorian and Eb dorian), So What is the gateway to modal jazz. The famous two-chord piano voicing (stacked fourths answered by bass) defines the sound.",
    "structure": "AABA — 32 bars. This excerpt: first A section (8 bars in D dorian)",
    "keyMoments": [
      "Bar 1-2: The iconic bass call — ascending answer from the piano in quartal voicings",
      "Bar 3-4: Melody floats over D dorian with cool detachment",
      "Bar 7-8: Phrase resolves gently — space and silence are part of the music"
    ],
    "teachingGoals": [
      "Quartal voicings — chords built in fourths instead of thirds",
      "D dorian mode — D E F G A B C D — the 'jazz minor' sound",
      "Less is more — Miles played fewer notes, not more"
    ],
    "styleTips": [
      "Leave space — the rests are as important as the notes",
      "The quartal voicing is E-A-D-G-B, not a traditional Dm chord",
      "Swing lightly — this is cool jazz, not hard bop. Stay relaxed."
