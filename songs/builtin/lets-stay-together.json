    "description": "Al Green's Memphis soul masterpiece features sophisticated chord movement with major and minor ninths, chromatic bass motion, and a silky smooth groove. This advanced arrangement includes extended chord voicings, inner voice movement, and a demanding left hand bass line that drives the iconic rhythm. The interplay between the lush harmony and floating melody demands refined coordination.",
    "structure": "Verse: Fmaj9-Am7-Dm9-Bbmaj7-Am7-Gm7-C9 (4 bars), Chorus: intensified with wider voicings (4 bars)",
    "keyMoments": [
      "Bar 1: Fmaj9 — the opening chord sets the silk standard.",
      "Bars 3-4: Bbmaj7 to Gm7 to C9 — the cascading descent that defines the song.",
      "Bars 7-8: The climactic passage with full extended voicings."
    ],
    "teachingGoals": [
      "Extended chord voicings — 9ths and major 7ths",
      "Chromatic bass movement and smooth voice leading",
      "Advanced two-hand coordination with independent rhythms"
    ],
    "styleTips": [
      "The groove should feel like velvet — smooth but with subtle rhythmic push",
      "Voice each chord carefully — every note in the voicing matters",
      "The bass line is the backbone — make it sing, not just thump"
