    "description": "Jobim's witty bossa nova about being out of tune is itself a masterclass in sophisticated harmony. The melody deliberately uses chromatic passing tones and altered chord extensions, creating a charming 'slightly off' quality that is actually perfectly calculated. The chord progression moves through diminished and augmented chords with elegant voice leading.",
    "structure": "A section: Fmaj7 through chromatic descents (4 bars), B section: altered dominants and tritone subs (4 bars)",
    "keyMoments": [
      "Bar 1: Fmaj7 — deceptively simple opening before the chromatic adventure.",
      "Bar 3: The Ab diminished passing chord — the 'desafinado' moment.",
      "Bars 5-7: Chain of altered dominants — the harmonic heart of the piece."

    "styleTips": [
      "The chromatic notes should sound deliberate, not accidental",
      "Bossa rhythm stays constant even when harmony gets adventurous",
      "Think of the melody as a singer who knows exactly how 'off' to be"
