    "description": "The 12-bar blues is the foundation of American popular music. Three chords (I-IV-V), twelve bars, infinite possibility. This version uses basic shuffle rhythm and dominant 7th chords. Once you can play this form, you can sit in with any blues band on the planet.",

    "keyMoments": [
      "Bars 1-4: C7 — four bars of the I chord. Establish the groove.",
      "Bars 5-6: F7 — the IV chord. This is where the blues 'opens up'.",
      "Bar 9: G7 — the V chord. Maximum tension. This is the turnaround launch.",
      "Bar 12: G7 — the turnaround. This pulls you back to bar 1 for another chorus."
