    "description": "One of the most beginner-friendly classic songs ever written. The verse uses just four chords (C-G-Am-F) in the most common pop progression of all time. The gentle tempo and repetitive structure make it ideal for a first 'real song' on piano.",
    "structure": "Verse (8 bars) — C-G-Am-F repeated twice",
    "keyMoments": [
      "Bars 1-2: C to G — the I-V movement. Simple, open, uplifting.",
      "Bars 3-4: Am to F — the vi-IV movement. This is where the emotion lives.",
      "Bars 5-8: The same progression repeats — lock in the muscle memory."
    ],
    "teachingGoals": [
      "Basic chord shapes in root position: C, G, Am, F",
      "Smooth chord transitions without pausing between changes",

    ],
    "styleTips": [
      "Gentle, hymn-like feel — no rushing",
      "Let each chord ring before moving to the next",
      "Right hand melody should float above the chords, soft and vocal"
