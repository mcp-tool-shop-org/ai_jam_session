    "description": "The most famous odd-meter jazz piece ever recorded. The 5/4 groove splits naturally into 3+2, with the left hand vamp anchoring the feel while the right hand carries the cool, understated melody. Paul Desmond wrote it; Dave Brubeck's quartet made it immortal.",
    "structure": "Vamp-based — A section (Ebm groove), 8 bars shown",
    "keyMoments": [
      "Bar 1: The iconic Ebm7-Bbm7 vamp begins — feel the 3+2 pulse",
      "Bar 3-4: Melody enters with that cool, floating quality over the vamp",
      "Bar 7-8: Melodic tension peaks before resolving back to the vamp"
    ],
    "teachingGoals": [
      "Feel 5/4 time as 3+2 — count ONE-two-three ONE-two",
      "Left-hand vamp independence while right hand plays melody",
      "Minor 7th chord voicings in Eb minor"
    ],
    "styleTips": [
      "Keep the left hand vamp steady and even — it is the entire groove",
      "Right hand melody should float above the vamp, relaxed and cool",
      "Do not rush the 5/4 — let each beat have its full weight"
