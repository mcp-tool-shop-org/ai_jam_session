    "description": "Marvin Gaye's smooth soul masterpiece floats on lush major seventh chords and a gently swaying rhythm. The arrangement emphasizes the song's dreamy quality with rich chord voicings in the left hand and a lyrical, unhurried melody in the right. The Emaj7 tonality gives it a warm, golden color.",

    "keyMoments": [
      "Bars 1-2: Emaj7 to C#m7 — the signature floating vamp.",
      "Bar 5: F#m7 — the harmony shifts and the energy lifts.",
      "Bar 8: B7 turnaround — smooth dominant pull back to the top."

    "styleTips": [
      "Everything should feel effortless — never push or rush",
      "The chords should shimmer, not thump — light left hand touch",
      "Think of the melody as Marvin's voice — smooth, floating, intimate"
