    "description": "A hard-swinging blues-jazz riff tune popularized by Oscar Peterson. Built on a simple, infectious riff over a 12-bar blues form, Night Train is pure energy and groove. The left hand drives with a walking bass feel while the right hand punches out the iconic riff pattern.",
    "structure": "12-bar blues riff form. This excerpt: first 8 bars (I and IV)",
    "keyMoments": [
      "Bar 1-2: The main riff — punchy, rhythmic, impossible not to tap your foot",
      "Bar 5-6: Riff transposes to the IV chord (C7) — same energy, new pitch",
      "Bar 7-8: Return to G7 with the riff building momentum"
    ],
    "teachingGoals": [
      "Riff-based playing — repeat a short phrase with conviction",
      "Walking bass in the left hand — steady quarter note motion",
      "Blues-jazz crossover style — harder swing than cool jazz"
    ],
    "styleTips": [
      "Swing HARD — this is Oscar Peterson, not a ballad. Dig in.",
      "The riff should be short and punchy — staccato quarter notes",
      "Left hand walks confidently — each note leading to the next"
