    "description": "The romantic piano theme from La La Land, played by Ryan Gosling's character in the film. The melody is built on cascading arpeggiated figures in A major that capture the magic and heartbreak of the story. The left hand plays jazz-influenced chord voicings while the right hand dances through the signature descending and ascending patterns that make this theme so memorable.",
    "structure": "A section: the cascading arpeggio theme (4 bars), B section: lyrical development and resolution (4 bars)",
    "keyMoments": [
      "Bar 1: The opening A major arpeggio cascade — pure romantic magic.",
      "Bars 3-4: The theme develops with wider intervals — reaching and yearning.",
      "Bars 7-8: The gentle landing — bittersweet resolution."

    "styleTips": [
      "The right hand should flow like water — never choppy or mechanical",
      "Use sustain pedal to create a wash of sound, changing with each chord",
      "Think of Ryan Gosling playing this at the piano — passionate but effortless"
