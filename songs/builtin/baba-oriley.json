    "description": "The iconic synthesizer riff adapted for piano. Pete Townshend's pulsing, repetitive arpeggio was originally created on a Lowrey organ with a sequencer. This piano arrangement captures the hypnotic, driving quality of the riff, cycling through F and Bb with relentless eighth-note energy.",
    "structure": "Riff (8 bars) — F major arpeggiated pattern with Bb and C chord variations",
    "keyMoments": [
      "Bars 1-4: The hypnotic F major riff — pure rhythmic energy building through repetition",
      "Bars 5-6: Bb chord variation — the harmony shifts while the rhythmic pattern continues",
      "Bars 7-8: C to F resolution — the riff completes its cycle with a satisfying cadence"

    "teachingGoals": [
      "Rapid arpeggiated patterns at a brisk tempo",

    "styleTips": [
      "Play with mechanical precision — this was originally a sequenced synth pattern",
      "Every note should be exactly the same volume and length — uniformity is the aesthetic",
      "The left hand should anchor solidly while the right hand drives the pattern"
