    "description": "Nino Rota's waltz from The Godfather evokes old-world Sicilian melancholy with its minor-key 3/4 time. The melody is deceptively simple — a haunting, circling theme that returns obsessively to D. The waltz rhythm in the left hand gives it an elegance that contrasts with the film's dark subject matter, creating that distinctive bittersweet Godfather atmosphere.",
    "structure": "A section: Dm waltz theme (4 bars), B section: ascending to relative major and back (4 bars)",
    "keyMoments": [
      "Bar 1: The opening D minor — dark, elegant, immediately recognizable.",
      "Bar 3: A7 — the dominant with its C# pulling back to D. Circular, obsessive.",
      "Bars 5-6: F major — the brief warmth of the relative major. Fleeting beauty."

    "styleTips": [
      "The waltz should feel old-world — think Sicilian village, not Viennese ballroom",
      "Left hand: bass note on 1, lighter chords on 2 and 3",
      "The melody circles back to D obsessively — let that repetition build atmosphere"
