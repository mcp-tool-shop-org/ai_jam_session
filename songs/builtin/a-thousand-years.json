    "description": "A modern romantic ballad with a gentle, flowing quality. The song uses a simple I-V-vi-IV progression in Bb major with a tender melodic line. This beginner arrangement simplifies the arpeggiated accompaniment to block chords while preserving the emotional melody.",
    "structure": "Verse (8 bars) — Bb-F-Gm-Eb repeated with melodic development",
    "keyMoments": [
      "Bars 1-2: Bb to F — the warm, open beginning that sets the romantic tone",
      "Bars 3-4: Gm to Eb — the emotional deepening as minor harmony enters",
      "Bars 7-8: The melody reaches its highest point then settles — a miniature emotional arc"
    ],
    "teachingGoals": [
      "Playing in Bb major — two flats (Bb and Eb)",
      "Slow, sustained left-hand chords with a singing melody",
      "Legato playing — connecting notes smoothly without gaps"
    ],
    "styleTips": [
      "Everything should feel warm and connected — no gaps between notes",
      "The slow tempo means every note matters — place each one carefully",
      "Think of the right hand as a cello solo — rich, sustained, singing"
