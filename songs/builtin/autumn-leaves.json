    "description": "The most-played jazz standard in the world. Written by Joseph Kosma in 1945 with French lyrics by Jacques Prevert, English lyrics by Johnny Mercer. The harmonic progression — a descending cycle of fifths through the relative major and minor — is the skeleton key to jazz harmony. Learn this and you've learned the language.",
    "structure": "AABC form (32 bars in the real book). This arrangement covers the A section — the iconic 8-bar chord cycle that every jazz musician knows by heart, played twice with variation.",
    "keyMoments": [
      "Measures 1-2: Cm7 to F7 — the ii-V in Bb major. The melody starts on C5 and steps down.",
      "Measures 3-4: Bbmaj7 to Ebmaj7 — the I and IV of Bb major. The warm center of the progression.",
      "Measures 5-6: Am7b5 to D7 — the ii-V in G minor. The harmony darkens, pulling toward the minor home.",
      "Measures 7-8: Gm — arrival. The whole cycle resolves here. G minor is home.",
      "Measure 9: The second pass begins — same chords, new melodic choices."
    ],
    "teachingGoals": [
      "The ii-V-I progression — the most common chord movement in jazz. Cm7-F7-Bbmaj7 is ii-V-I in Bb major.",
      "Left hand voicings: rootless or shell voicings (3rd and 7th) with the root implied",
      "Right hand melody: stepwise motion with occasional leaps, always landing on chord tones",
      "Swing feel: eighth notes are not even. The first eighth is longer, the second shorter (triplet feel).",
      "The circle of fifths: Cm7→F7→Bb→Eb→Am7b5→D7→Gm. Each root falls a fifth."
    ],
    "styleTips": [
      "Swing the eighths. If it sounds straight, it's not jazz.",
      "The left hand chords should be quiet — comping, not competing with the melody",
      "Don't rush. Jazz breathes. Leave space between phrases.",
      "The D7 to Gm resolution (measures 5-8) is where the emotion lives. Let it pull.",
      "Think of the melody as a story being told, not notes being played"

      "teachingNote": "Cm7 chord. The melody climbs stepwise from C5 to F5 — a simple ascending line that outlines the chord. Left hand plays C (root), Eb (minor 3rd), Bb (7th) — a shell voicing. This is the ii chord in Bb major.",

      "teachingNote": "F7 chord — the V of Bb major. The melody settles on Eb5 then D5, both chord tones of F7 (7th and 6th). Left hand: F (root), A (3rd), Eb (7th). The tritone A-Eb wants to resolve."
