    "description": "The most famous song from The Wizard of Oz opens with one of music's most recognizable intervals — an octave leap. This beginner arrangement in C major captures the song's hopeful, dreaming quality with simple chord voicings. The melody is tuneful and singable, moving mostly by step after the dramatic opening jump.",
    "structure": "A section: the octave leap and descent (4 bars), B section: bridge with stepwise melody (4 bars)",
    "keyMoments": [
      "Bar 1: The octave leap from C4 to C5 — 'Somewhere, over the rainbow.'",
      "Bars 3-4: The melody settles into stepwise motion — dreaming of a better place.",
      "Bars 7-8: The hopeful return — quiet confidence that dreams come true."

      "The octave leap should feel like a wish — hopeful, not forceful",
      "After the leap, the melody should settle gently like landing on a cloud",
